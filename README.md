This is my submission for Aisle Skill test:

Do run pod install before building the iOS-Project.

I've implemented this Aisle skill test using VIPER Architecture.
Gist About VIPER -
 -> View is responsible for User Interface, i.e what is shown to user
 -> Interactor  is responsible for API Calling, Data Storage and all the business logic.
 -> Presenter acts like a brain, i.e it makes all the decisions.
 -> Entity/Models contains The Structure of Models that View, Presenter, Interactor accepts.
 -> Router is responsible for navigation logic.
